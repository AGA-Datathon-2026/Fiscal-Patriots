## Relevance to This Project

2 CFR 200 Subpart F governs Single Audit requirements for non-federal entities expending $750,000 or more in federal awards. It is the regulatory foundation for our Audit Health Score weighting, including repeat findings (§200.516), corrective action plans (§200.511(c)), and low-risk auditee designation (§200.520).
