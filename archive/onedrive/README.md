# OneDrive Snapshot (Archive)

This folder mirrors the team OneDrive structure for traceability and backup.

Main branch stays clean, contains only:
- analysis-ready core datasets
- pipeline artifacts
- final deliverables

Everything else (raw files, variants, templates, recordings, etc.) lives here
